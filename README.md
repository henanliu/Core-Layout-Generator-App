# Core-Layout-Generator-App
A Python app to automatically generate elevator core layouts for high-rise towers

Initially created in 2023.

The goal is to create a simple app to quickly populate core layouts for high-rise towers from argument-like input, ie. number of elevators, size of the vestibule, preferred shape of the lobby, etc.

The end goal is not only to populate layouts but to rate and sort them based on a pre-defined scoring mechanism or supervised learning.
